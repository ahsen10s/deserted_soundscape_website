# deserted_soundscape_website


<h4>Project Description</h4>
This website houses audio recordings of a naive explorer slowly decending into madness as he ventures unprepared into the uncharted territories of the Red Desert alone. What does he find? or the better question might be; what finds him? These records are the the only thing remaining of the explorer, which was coincidentally uncovered by bedouin tribes crossing the area months later, and submitted to authorities.

<h4>Process</h4>
We began our discussions with the idea of a desert adventure, which later took a darker horror tone. We were inspired by the old tales of cursed spirits in the desert that are told in the region, and tried recreating it. First we made a loose frame of our story and began improvising recordings. After multiple takes, we finalised on a script we were happy with and recorded the final pieces. Next we combined our audio with other sounds effects on audioscape in order to create the atmosphere we aimed for. Finally, we worked on the website that houses the audio recordings, aiming to enhance the audio and provide a complete storytelling package.

<h4>My Contributions</h4>
a) Helped with scripting the audio recordings
b) icon placements on website
c) Importing audio and some images
d) javascript functions to play, pause and switch between recordings
e) display audio players
f) fix bugs

<h4>Evaluation</h4>
I am happy with the final website and enjoyed creating it. I believe it conveys a cohesive story well, with high-quality audio and fun interactions. I wanted to dive deeper into the retro operating system design of the website and incorporate more interactions but time was a major constraint, so I could not attempt this. I hope to provide a more immersive experience in my following projects.
